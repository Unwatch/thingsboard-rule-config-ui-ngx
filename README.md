Configuration UI for ThingsBoard Rule Nodes

## Build steps

1) Cleanup
    ```
    yarn cache clean
    ```
    yarn run cleanup 
    ```
2) Get ThingsBoard UI dependency
    ```
    Please try to remove ui-ngx/target and ui-ngx/node_modules folders and try to build one more time.
    ```
    Please try to yarn.lock file.
    ```
    yarn run getthingsboard 
    ```
3) Install dependencies
    ```
    yarn install 
    ```
4) Production build    
    ```
    yarn run build 
    ```
    Resulting JavaScript should be here:
    ```
    ./target/generated-resources/public/static/rulenode-core-config.js
    ```
5) Deploy Rule Nodes UI JavaScript code to ThingsBoard

    Resulting **rulenode-core-config.js**
    should be copied to ```rule-engine/rule-engine-components/src/main/resources/public/static/rulenode/```
    directory of ThingsBoard repository.

6) Run Rule Nodes UI in hot redeploy mode

    ```
    yarn start
    ```
    
    By default, Rule Nodes UI will be available on port 5000 (http://localhost:5000)
